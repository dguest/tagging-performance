# Jet Tagging Performance Plots

This is to test things. 

## Required Packages 

Unfortunately there are a few dependencies. The upshot is that these packages are fairly standard for python data analysis, and thus quite easy to use. They are generally installed using something like `python3.3 setup.py install`.  

- [Python 3.3][1] is used throughout
- [Numpy][4] 
- HDF5 is used for binary data storage: 
 + [HDF5][2] basic library 
 + [h5py][3] for python bindings
- [pyyaml][5] for [yaml][6]
- [matplotlib][7] for plotting 
- [scipy][8] for various functions (currently not required)
